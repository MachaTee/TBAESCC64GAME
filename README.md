# TBAESCC64GAME
Pilot project for C64 game for TBAES

This is the pilot for a Commodore 64 game I am writing for TBAES using C

At the moment the project is in it's infancy, there is only one map and you spawn with items (the invnetory menu is still buggy)
There are 4 slime enemies in the room and they wipe away your tracks.

Currently I am working on fixing the dodgy inventory menu.

rl_c64.prg    - Compiled C64 Binary

rl.c          - Main program code

utilities.h   - Header file containing utility functions such as getting the log10 of an integer

items.h       - Header file containing data for items
