# TBAESCC64GAME
Pilot project for C64 game for TBAES

This is the pilot for a Commodore 64 game I am writing for TBAES using C

At the moment the project is in it's infancy, there is only one map and you spawn with items (the invnetory menu is still buggy)
There are 4 slime enemies in the room and they wipe away your tracks.

Currently I am working on fixing the dodgy inventory menu.
